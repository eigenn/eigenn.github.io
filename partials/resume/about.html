			<h1>About</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
				I really enjoy problem solving, from building large scale web application to sudoku.Im one of those lucky people who find what they want to do in they lifeâ€™s, for me that is software development. Im originally came from Slovakia but now I live and code in London. When I'm not coding I do street photography around the town. When I'm not in London, you will almost certainly found me in Souther Spain drinking some Cruzcampo in "chiringuito" or canoeing down the sea.
